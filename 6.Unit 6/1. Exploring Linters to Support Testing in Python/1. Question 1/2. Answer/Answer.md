Testing with Python
Exploring Linters to Support Testing in Python: Question 1
Run styleLint.py.

What happens when the code is run?

Answer:
I receive an error saying
IndentationError: expected an indented block after function definition on line 4
The issue is there is no indentation for the code to be inside the function.

Can you modify this code for a more favourable outcome?

Answer:
Yes. I can indent the code to be inside the function to work properly and add an indentation for the code under the if statement.

What amendments have you made to the code?

Answer:
I indented the code to be inside the factorial function and indented the code for the if statement.
